[bells chiming]

2
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,774
[Joe] <i>Well, hello there.</i>

3
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,943
<i>Who are you?</i>

4
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>Based on your vibe, a student.</i>

5
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>Your blouse is loose.</i>

6
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>You're not here to be ogled,</i>
<i>but those bracelets, they jangle.</i>

7
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,954
<i>You like a little attention.</i>

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,998
<i>Okay, I bite.</i>

9
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:44,544
<i>You search the books.</i>
<i>Fiction, "F" through "K."</i>

10
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,837
<i>Now...</i>

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,964
<i>Hmm, you're not</i>
<i>the standard insecure nymph</i>

12
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>hunting for Faulkner you'll never finish.</i>

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>Too sun-kissed for Stephen King.</i>

14
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>Who will you buy?</i>

15
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,057
[Beck gasps] Sorry.

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:03,021
[Joe] <i>You sound apologetic,</i>
<i>like you're embarrassed to be a good girl,</i>

17
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,690
<i>and you murmur your first word to me.</i>

18
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,152
Hello.

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,278
Do you work here?

20
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,572
Guilty.

21
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,116
-Can I help you find something?
-Paula Fox.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
It's a good choice.

23
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,369
Hmm, I feel weirdly validated.

24
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,456
[chuckles] Follow me.

25
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:25,960
She's gonna be in here.

26
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,547
"Celebrity authors"?
I thought Fox was pretty obscure.

27
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,967
She is Courtney Love's
maternal grandmother.

28
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,177
You're not expected to know that.

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,887
Good. I didn't.

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,224
Mr. Mooney wants anyone in here
who's even tangentially famous.

31
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,558
He thinks it sells more books.

32
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,893
That's sad.

33
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,728
People buying books
because of what's popular,

34
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,898
and not because they wanna be moved
or changed in some way.

35
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,151
Yeah. It's an epidemic.

36
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,031
Yeah, you see this guy?
Here, the glasses, behind you.

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,118
He just grabbed Dan Brown's latest
on the way in.

38
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,913
So he's gonna wander around
for another, like, five or ten minutes,

39
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,623
just to find something legitimate
to buy with it.

40
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,626
Oh, like the cereal guys buy
when they're really there for condoms.

41
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,629
Only makes it more conspicuous.
Like, own your shit.

42
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,423
If Dan Brown's your kink,
then be out about it.

43
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,094
[scoffs] At the end of the day,

44
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,429
people really are disappointing,
aren't they?

45
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,182
Sometimes they surprise you.

46
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,021
-Paula Fox. Top shelf. You want me to...
-Oh, no, I got it.

47
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,486
[Joe] <i>Oh. Are you not wearing a bra?</i>

48
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,655
<i>And you want me to notice.</i>

49
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,948
<i>If this was a movie,</i>

50
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:41,494
<i>I'd grab you</i>
<i>and we'd go at it right in the stacks.</i>

51
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,873
Have you read her fiction?
<i>Desperate Characters, </i>it's her best.

52
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,541
[sighs] That's what I keep hearing.

53
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,793
-You haven't read <i>Desperate Characters?</i>
-I know. I know.

54
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm worried
it's not gonna live up to the hype.

55
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,589
I can safely say it is that good.

56
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,384
That's a high endorsement.
And from a bookstore clerk, nonetheless.

57
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,052
Well, it's bookstore manager.

58
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,138
Hello? Anyone working here?

59
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,682
-Asshole.
-Mmm...

60
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,435
-Whoa.
-[chuckles]

61
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,816
Do you mind? Uh, I'm in a hurry.

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,569
[Joe] <i>He's just pissed he's gotta</i>
<i>buy Salinger to feel respectable</i>

63
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,072
<i>when all he really wants to do</i>
<i>is eat Cheetos and jerk it to iPorn</i>

64
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,201
<i>before washing it all down</i>
<i>with a Dan Brown chaser.</i>

65
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,453
Have a nice day, sir.

66
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,001
Okay, I'm going for it.

67
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,795
-Good. You won't regret it.
-I'd better not.

68
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,505
Paula Fox. Nice.

69
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,175
You know, she was, uh,
Courtney Love's maternal grandmother.

70
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,384
That's why I'm buying it.

71
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,308
[Joe] <i>You have enough cash to cover this,</i>
<i>but you want me to know your name.</i>

72
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,518
-"Guinevere"?
-Yeah.

73
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,438
My parents were assholes
with the whole naming thing.

74
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,190
But everyone just calls me Beck.

75
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,985
And you're Joe...

76
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,028
Goldberg.

77
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,989
Everyone calls me Joe.

78
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,199
[chuckles]

79
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,037
Aren't you gonna tell me
to have a nice day?

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,039
You have a nice day, Beck.

81
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,916
You have one yourself, Joe.

82
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,090
[Joe] <i>You smiled, laughed at my jokes,</i>

83
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>told me your name, asked for mine.</i>

84
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,847
She write her number on there?
She was on you hard.

85
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
No, she was just being nice.

86
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,476
I'd be googling the hell out of her
right now.

87
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,519
You know her full name.

88
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,854
That's pretty aggressive, Ethan.

89
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,775
What do I tell you?
Always be closing that shit.

90
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,946
[both] If you need me,
I'll be in cookbooks.

91
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,699
But for work. Not for fun. I swear.

92
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,995
[Joe] <i>At the end of the day, people are</i>
<i>really just disappointing, aren't they?</i>

93
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,713
<i>But are you, Beck? Are you?</i>

94
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,859
<i>Yes, people find "the one." </i>

95
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,321
<i>I believe that. I try to stay open.</i>

96
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,657
<i>I was in love once.</i>
<i>She broke my heart, Beck.</i>

97
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,201
<i>Ugh, she really did a number on me.</i>

98
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,329
<i>I should've seen the signs.</i>

99
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,540
<i>But we never do when we're in love.</i>

100
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,460
<i>-Exhibit A. Claudia and Ron.</i>
-[indistinct arguing]

101
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,129
[Ron] I went out for a couple of drinks.
Get off my back.

102
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,631
[Joe] <i>Claudia's a nurse. Single parent.</i>

103
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,008
[Claudia] Leave me alone!
You're on your phone...

104
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,803
[Joe] <i>You think she knew Ron was a shitbag</i>
<i>when she fell in love?</i>

105
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,430
<i>No, she thought he was a prince.</i>

106
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,140
Hey, Paco.

107
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,059
'Sup, Joe?

108
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:51,976
[Joe] <i>And now,</i>

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,896
<i>-hers is not the only life she ruined.</i>
-[Claudia] Leave me alone!

110
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,066
Why is coming home such a chore for you?
[continues indistinctly]

111
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,233
Is everything cool in there?

112
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,402
Yeah, Mom and Ron are just talking.

113
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,361
[Claudia] You always go out
with your friends!

114
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,946
-And I'm sick of it!
-Wow.

115
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,115
You are burning through that book,
aren't you?

116
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,118
Reads quick. It's good.

117
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,205
Let me know when you finish.
I'll get you another one.

118
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,249
[Claudia] Screw you, Ron! Get out of here!
Leave me alone.

119
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,834
[continues indistinctly]

120
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,835
Are you hungry?

121
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,506
'Cause, you know,
I just got this meatball sub,

122
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,508
but I remembered
I have Thai from last night.

123
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,512
Nah. My mom will just
make me something later.

124
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,139
That's a shame. This won't keep.
It's getting tossed.

125
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,391
You sure, Joe?

126
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
"All for one and one for all."

127
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,539
[Joe] <i>The point, Beck...</i>
<i>Love is, uh, tricky.</i>

[Joe] <i>A guy needs to protect himself.</i>

130
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,938
<i>I had to be sure you're safe. </i>

131
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,691
<i>And your name</i>
<i>was a glorious place to start.</i>

132
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,818
<i>Not a lot of Guinevere Becks.</i>

133
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>And there you were.</i>
<i>Every account set to public.</i>

134
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,452
<i>You want to be seen, heard, known.</i>

135
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,912
<i>Of course, I obliged.</i>

136
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,125
<i>Born and raised, Nantucket Island.</i>

137
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,003
<i>A brother, Clyde, and sister, Anya.</i>

138
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,173
<i>Your parents really were assholes</i>
<i>about the names.</i>

139
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,343
<i>Your folks split when you were 12.</i>
<i>Your dad dropped out of the picture.</i>

140
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,472
<i>Went to Brown</i>
<i>where you majored in lit. Cool.</i>

141
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,932
<i>And minored in douchebags. Hmm.</i>

142
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,769
<i>And then on to NYC to conquer an MFA</i>
<i>and make your mark, presumably.</i>

143
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,897
<i>Now you still write. Barely.</i>

144
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,774
<i>Too busy living out moments</i>
<i>you won't remember five years from now.</i>

145
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,778

<i>If anything, the fact that</i>

00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,556
<i>Just you and me?</i>

168
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,684
[Beck] <i>To everyone out there</i>
<i>chasing their dreams, don't give up.</i>

169
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,770
<i>And in the meantime, mac and cheese!</i>

170
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:30,278
[Joe] <i>It's cute. Not deep. But cute.</i>
<i>Is there more to you? Let's find out.</i>

171
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,957
<i>Our day starts at the ass-crack of dawn.</i>

172
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,585
<i>I know from your posted schedule</i>
<i>that you teach a 6:30 class</i>

173
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,378
<i>called Get Up N Flow.</i>

174
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:52,133
<i>You caress the sweaty backs of bulimic,</i>
<i>dead-eyed real mommies of SoHo...</i>

175
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,677
I am loving your form today, Tasha.

176
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,388
[Joe] <i>...offering smiles</i>
<i>and lies of encouragement.</i>

177
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,639
[Beck continues indistinctly]

178
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,934
[Joe] <i>By 10:00, you're at campus</i>
<i>to TA a Romantics class</i>

179
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,769
<i>and play Vanna White to some shirt.</i>

180
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,688
Morning, Professor Leahy.

181
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,858
I told you, it's Paul.
Are you ready for class?

182
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,484
[Joe] <i>Professor Obvious wants to fuck you.</i>

183
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,739
<i>Now, you're smart.</i>
<i>You let him think one day he might.</i>

184
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,073
<i>And what's the harm in that, right?</i>

185
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,661
<i>After class,</i>
<i>you head to your favorite café</i>

186
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,289
<i>to write for the first time all day.</i>

187
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,249
<i>But your life doesn't cooperate.</i>

188
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,420
<i>Your wealthy girlfriends</i>
<i>have just now woken up,</i>

189
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,838
<i>and have nothing better to do</i>

190
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,175
<i>than plan their next pointless</i>
<i>yet instagrammable night.</i>

191
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,010
<i>Can we get real for a second?</i>

192
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,095
<i>You have questionable taste in friends,</i>
<i>Beck.</i>

193
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,312
-[all] Cheers!
-Yeah!

194
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,939
-Oh, yes. Happy birthday!
-[Annika laughs] Thank you so much.

195
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,610
[Joe] <i>And expensive taste in lives.</i>

196
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,195
-Ready?
-Thank you.

197
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,865
-[gasps]
-Do you like it?

198
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,160
No, I hate it. Of course I love it!

199
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,745
Jason didn't even
get her something that nice,

200
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,622
and Annika finally let him do anal.

201
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,667
-[Lynn] Oh, my God!
-Please, please, it was time.

202
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,920
Please open my gift next and tell me
how much you hate me then, lady.

203
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,800
[Annika gasps]

204
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,513
A butterfly? It's my spirit animal
for the year. You remembered?

205
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,348
Only 'cause you wouldn't shut up about it.

206
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,351
[Joe]<i> You want so badly to be one of them.</i>

207
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,727
-[Beck] Happy birthday.
-[Annika] You look so beautiful.

208
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,104
[Joe] <i>Well, they've got nothing to do</i>
<i>after this.</i>

209
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>So, yeah, they'll party till 5:00</i>
<i>and scrape it together tomorrow.</i>

210
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,567
<i>But you can't.</i>
<i>You have to work for a living.</i>

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,238
A McQueen, Beck? How much was it?

212
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,864
[chuckles] It was on clearance.

213
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
They haven't put a McQueen scarf
on clearance

214
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,618
since he hung himself in 2010.

215
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
It'd be too much
even if she did deserve it,

216
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,539
which she does not.

217
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,958
[Joe]<i> Hmm. Not all your friends are dumb.</i>

218
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,418
[Peach] You always do this.

219
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,046
You make, like, a big gesture
that you can't afford because...

220
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,218
-[scoffs] I'm sorry, you're too nice.
-It's no big deal. I had, um, a gift card.

221
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,595
How broke are you?

222
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,349
Just tell me what's up.

223
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,976
[Joe] <i>Actually sounds like she cares.</i>

224
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,853
[Beck] Look, I appreciate--

225
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,564
[Peach] Why don't you just let me
loan you some cash?

226
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,566
Okay? I keep telling you, it's nothing.

227
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,151
[Joe] <i>Also, sounds condescending.</i>

228
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,905
You know I'd do anything for you.
Don't forget that.

229
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,201
-Sure you can't come out with us?
-I gotta write.

230
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,036
Virtuous. Catch you later?

231
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,169
[Joe] <i>Is that the best friend you've got?</i>

232
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,422
<i>If so, Beck, you really are alone.</i>

233
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,934
<i>Your social media's a liar.</i>

234
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,271
<i>It says</i>
<i>you're a happy-go-lucky dilettante.</i>

235
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,943
<i>But, underneath it all,</i>
<i>you seem like the genuine article.</i>

236
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,447
<i>Stretched ADD thin, sure,</i>
<i>but as soon as the door closes...</i>

237
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,782
<i>you're back at the keyboard,</i>
<i>trying to write.</i>

238
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,369
[cell phone vibrates]

239
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,584
[sighs]

240
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,803
[man] Thanks.

241
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,600
Keep the change, man.

242
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,772
Hey. Let me up.

243
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,234
[Joe] <i>Uh, Beck, who the fuck is this?</i>

244
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,078
My best friend walked in
on you getting your dick sucked

245
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,998
by some random woman in a bathroom
at a party that I took you to!

246
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,042
I was wasted. I didn't even finish.

247
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,504
That's your apology? "I didn't cum."
That's the one you're going with?

248
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,047
I obviously shouldn't have gone
in the bathroom

249
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,298
with any girl that wasn't you.

250
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:05,261
But she said she had good coke,
and I'd been seriously stressed.

251
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,180
I thought,
when Johno and I started our line,

252
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,099
it was gonna be like
picking out flavors and shit.

253
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,185
It turns out it's 16-hour lectures
on microbial management.

254
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,771
And that's why no one starts
their own artisanal soda company,

255
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,566
and why America has to keep drinking crap
that's giving 'em cancer.

256
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,570
You actually managed to connect
your illicit blowjob to curing cancer.

257
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,406
I'm genuinely impressed.

258
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,910
Beck, I...

259
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,664
Seriously, I am drowning in work.

260
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:38,085
I don't have time to keep hooking up
or whatever it is you're even capable of.

261
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,965
I know I've done some stupid shit,
but I'm on it now.

262
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,262
I don't wanna be
just some guy you sleep with.

263
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,684
[whispering] God, you make me insane.

[Joe] <i>Way to go, Beck.</i>

<i>Oh, there's three of them.</i>

Saged the crap out of the office.

292

The book title
has the word "desperate" in it.

293
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,273
You don't want to think of yourself
as a desperate character, Beck.

294
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,987
Because you're the opposite, babe.

295

Hey, you should come by the office,
test out some new flavors.

Sure. Sounds good.

Yeah, don't dick me over like last time.
Gluten-free crust.

No. Johno. Johno. Listen to me.

312
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,629
They can't do half-gluten-free
'cause it's dough.

313
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,298

and still all nice about it.

329
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,709
Well, it was the 19th century.
People still had manners.

330
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,254
I was hoping we could go get another one.

331
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,550
[sighs] I mean, it's pretty late, Pac.
I don't know.

332
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,760
[Claudia moaning] Oh, yeah.

333
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,013
I want you to cum...

334
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,264
[Joe] <i>Something's</i>
<i>in the air tonight, Beck,</i>

335
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,642
<i>'cause everyone but me is getting action.</i>

336
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,895
<i>Even the lovebirds made up.</i>

337
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,647
Yeah. Yeah, why not? Sure.

338
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,611
[Paco] Did you know
Dumas was a black dude? I googled him.

339
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,655
His grandmother was a slave,
and his dad was a brigadier general.

340
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,407
He killed like half a battalion.

341
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,493
You probably knew that
since you work at a bookstore.

342
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,120
I didn't.

343
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,706
-How'd you get to work here, anyway?
-Mr. Mooney gave me a job

344
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,250
when I was just a little older than you.
He sort of took me in.

345
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,252
-He seems nice.
-He's a dick.

346
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,381
But he loved books,
and he taught me to love them, too.

347
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,716
I never see him around here.

348
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,594
-Is he dead?
-No. He's just old.

349
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,887
I'm sorry, Pac.

350
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,348
I had one back here for you,
but Ethan must've sold it.

351
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,100
-Sold what?
-Your next read.

352
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,852
Come on. I'll show you
where we keep the good stuff.

353
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,411
[Paco] Freaky.

354
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,293
It's the Cage.

355
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,255
It's where we keep
early editions and collectibles.

356
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,881
It's cold.

357
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,259
Sixty-five degrees. For the books.

358
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,719
If the zombies come,
this is where I'm hiding.

359
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,722
Why don't you set that milkshake down?

360
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,202
[Mooney] <i>Careful, Joseph.</i>

361
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:32,708
When it comes to the value of a book,
it's all about condition. I'll show you.

362
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,084
[Joe] <i>It's always 65 degrees.</i>

363
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,797
Humidity 40%.
Too moist, the pages can mildew...

364
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,465
[Mooney] <i>Too dry, they get brittle.</i>

365
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,759
Always keep books upright

366
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,054
so the spines don't become rolled
or warped or what we call "cocked."

367
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,224
And we never wanna
fold or crease the pages.

368
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,019
And we dust the covers
with a chemical-free duster.

369
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,603
Always towards the spine.

370
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,065
Under no circumstances
is there any sunlight in this room.

371
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,401
Sunlight can ruin a book as fast as fire.

372
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,944
Faster.

373
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,865
That's a lot of stuff to remember
just to take care of some old books.

374
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,827
The most valuable things in life
are usually...

375
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
the most helpless.

376
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,626
So they need people like us
to protect them. You know?

377
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,301
<i>"Don Quicks-oat."</i>

378
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,054
<i>Quixote.</i>
It's about a guy who believes in chivalry,

379
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,972
so he decides to be an old-school knight.

380
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,140
What's chivalry?

381
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,602
It's treating people with respect.
Especially women. Like men should.

382
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,312
It's good. It's one of my favorites.

383
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,023
I probably shouldn't take this home.

384
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,649
It's not a first edition,
it's just an old one.

385
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,276
Besides, I trust you.

386
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,463
-Where you been, Paco?
-We just grabbed some milkshakes.

387
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,966
-You just walk off with strangers?
-Joe's not a stranger.

388
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,259
Yes, he is.

389
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,261
Inside. Now. Okay?

390
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,188
Keep away from my girlfriend's kid.

391
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,317
Look, I'm sorry, but he was out here,
and he could hear everything in there.

392
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,610
Don't you tell me how to parent.

393
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,655
This whole nice guy act
might work on other people.

394
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,699
I'm a parole officer, 15 years,
and I can see what you are.

395
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,202
[Joe] <i>Well, you're an alcoholic shitbag</i>
<i>who beats women.</i>

396
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,454
<i>So, please, enlighten me.</i>

397
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,581
You're a freak.

398
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,584
So, stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

399
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,962
I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

400
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,716
[Joe] <i>There are scary people</i>
<i>in the world, Beck.</i>

401
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,677
<i>That's why it's important to be safe.</i>

402
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,434
<i>And why I have to do what I'm about to do.</i>

403
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,026
<i>Fun fact.</i>

404
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,698
<i>Did you know the law requires</i>
<i>gas leaks to be investigated?</i>

405
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,241
<i>I've been learning a lot since I met you.</i>

406
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,493
Hey, Beck? You left the door open again.

407
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,620
I thought we said
we weren't gonna do that anymore.

408
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,582
<i>I was careful to call the gas company</i>
<i>on a day when you had a full schedule.</i>

409
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,916
<i>I wouldn't wanna scare you.</i>

410
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,793
Hey. Is Beck here?

411
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,212
Nope. Super let me in.
Someone reported a leak.

412
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,131
Right. Yeah. She mentioned that.
Is everything okay?

413
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,884
Yeah, all clear.
Tell your girlfriend there's no leak.

414
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,468
I'm done, so...

415
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,762
Okay. Thanks. Well, I can just lock up.

416
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,978
<i>I just need to know who you really are.</i>

417
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,813
<i>Besides a broke poetry student</i>

418
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,441
<i>in a subsidized apartment</i>
<i>you could never afford.</i>

419
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,610
<i>Where is it, Beck?</i>

420
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,905
<i>When we live together,</i>
<i>your place won't be a pigsty. </i>

421
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,031
<i>I'll clean for us. </i>

422
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,912
<i>And you won't eat all this frozen shit.</i>
<i>I'll cook for you every day. I promise.</i>

423
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,377
<i>I'll even do your laundry.</i>

424
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,465
<i>And take care of your favorite books.</i>

425
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,220
<i>I'll make our bed every morning.</i>

426
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,514
<i>Oh, there it is.</i>

427
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,183
<i>And no matter how hard you fight me,</i>

428
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,062
<i>I will always make sure</i>
<i>you password protect your devices.</i>

429
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,735
[Leahy] <i>"One day</i>
<i>You won't need love anymore</i>

430
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,404
<i>One day, you won't walk through the world</i>

431
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,782
<i>As though it was your job</i>
<i>To hold everything up</i>

432
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,619
The sun, the sky
The hard part of the night"

433
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,746
It's good.

434
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,290
It's quite good.

435
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,378
But, Beck, where's the rest?
You owe me 20 more pages.

436
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:51,132
[sighs] I've been, honestly,
working every day, and grading papers--

437
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,051
If the schedule is too rigorous,
drop back to part-time.

438
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,803
But then I won't qualify to TA.

439
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,430
I need the cash. The housing.
I'd lose my place.

440
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,516
You'll figure it out.
You're smart, or you wouldn't be here.

441
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,643
-Please, Professor Leahy--
-Paul.

442
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,981
Paul. I'll get you the pages
by the end of the week.

443
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,651
I can't go to part-time, okay?

444
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,572
[sighs] I'm rooting for you.

445
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,492
You just need to keep up.

446
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,371
Happy to discuss further.
After class some evening.

447
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,832
If we're gonna seriously discuss poetry,
it should be over a drink.

448
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,959
There's a little gastropub I love...

449
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,753
I would love that, Paul. [chuckles]

450
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,173
Just, uh, how would your wife feel
about you--

451
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,886
About me helping out an aspiring writer?
She's used to my generosity.

452
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,138
[chuckles]

453
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,931
[Leahy] So, Thursday night, then?

454
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,435
Thursday night it is.

455
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,436
Excellent.

456
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,815
And don't worry about the next few days.
Just go home and get caught up.

457
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,369
[Beck] <i>Need to see you tonight.</i>

458
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,958
[Benji] <i>Will if I can, babe.</i>
<i>Working late.</i>

459
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,295
<i>P.S., I can still smell you on my fingers.</i>

460
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,215
[Joe] <i>I learned two definitive things</i>
<i>by scouring your computer.</i>

461
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,428
<i>First, there are no recent pictures</i>
<i>of your dad because he's dead. </i>

462
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,264
<i>He OD'd and you were the one</i>
<i>that found him.</i>

463
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,226
<i>You've started a few poems about that day,</i>
<i>but you never finished them.</i>

464
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,228
<i>I'm so sorry, Beck.</i>

465
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,274
<i>But none of this matters because of</i>
<i>my second and greatest discovery. </i>

466
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,652
<i>11:06 a.m., an hour after</i>
<i>our encounter at the bookstore,</i>

467
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,448
<i>amidst a group text on the merits</i>
<i>of vaginal detoxing, you wrote...</i>

468
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,660
[Beck] <i>Wow. Just met a human male</i>
<i>who actually reads.</i>

469
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,287
<i>Alert the media.</i>

470
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,207
<i>What if it's finally time for me</i>
<i>to date someone good for me?</i>

471
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,292
[Joe] <i>Thank you for letting me know</i>

472
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,960
<i>-I wasn't crazy after all.</i>
-[door unlocks]

473
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,878
[Joe]<i> No!</i>

474
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,507
Yes, I remember what you said
when you sent money last.

475
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,259
Yes, I'm grateful.

476
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,932
[scoffs] I'm working constantly.
There's no place cheaper to live.

477
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,105
I did.
He basically offered to sleep with me.

478
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,315
No, I can't report him.
That's not how it works.

479
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,526
[Joe] <i>I'm not worried.</i>
<i>I've seen enough romantic comedies</i>

480
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,237
<i>to know guys like me</i>
<i>are always getting in jams like this.</i>

481
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,323
Not the school, the world.
That's not how the world works.

482
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,745
I know how much you helped me,
it's just... It's hard here, Mom.

483
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,873
[sighs]

484
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,419
Okay. I'll figure it out.

485
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,587
All right. Love you, too.

486
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,047
Bye, Mom.

487
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,052
[crying]

488
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,727
[Joe] <i>It's okay, Beck.</i>

All of my life lately

527
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,743
I need to remind myself

He texted a row of smile emojis,

00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,317
I mean, I read a lot of poetry.

656
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,112
Who do you like?

657
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,616
Strand, Sexton, Merrill...

658
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,993
You're describing my nightstand.

659
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,538
[scoffs] Well, if you read them
to get to sleep every night,

660
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,582
then you definitely belong here.

661
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,671
-What was your last name again?
-Goldberg.

662
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,633
Where did you come from, Joe Goldberg?

663
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,718
I grew up here.

664
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,640
I left for a little while. Chasing a girl.

665
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,935
-But you came back?
-Yeah, I missed it.

666
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,688
And I'm not a good chaser.

667
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,648
[sighs] Me neither.

668
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,001
[groans]

669
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,755
Oh, this is, uh... This is me.

670
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,383
Mmm-hmm. It's not bad.

671
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,677
Thank you for sobering me up.

672
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,263
And for saving my life.

673
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,724
No, I didn't...
I didn't save your life.

674
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,933
Yeah, you did.

675
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,525
[knock on window]

676
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,069
Oh, God.

677
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,738
[Joe] <i>Of course.</i>

678
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,781
<i>-Benji.</i>
-[Beck] Hi.

679
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,786
Um, this is Joe.
He literally saved my life tonight.

680
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,123
I... I fell on the tracks. It was crazy.

681
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,625
Babe, I told you
people are basically good.

682
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,794
It's a great job, bro.

683
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,505
[Joe] <i>"Bro." You waste of hair.</i>

684
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,133
Okay. Beck, it's freezing out here.

685
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:13,434
-Wait. Maybe I can get your info...
-Yeah. Um...

686
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,731
Shit!

687
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,484
My phone!

688
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,779
-I must've dropped it in the subway.
-Oh.

689
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:29,241
Uh, okay, well.
Just maybe give me your number,

690
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,826
for when you get a replacement.

691
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,329
I'm basically enslaved to e-mail.

692
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,291
[Joe] <i>I get it. Smart. I'm practically</i>
<i>a stranger. Can't be too careful.</i>

693
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,584
Okay.

694
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,587
It's BeckInRealLife@gmail.com

695
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,839
-[typing]
-All right.

696
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,385
"Beck in real life."

697
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,095
Thank you.

698
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,433
[Joe] <i>Here's what I learned this week.</i>

699
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,476
[Benji] Sorry I didn't make it, you know?

700
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,146
[Joe] <i>You are special. You're talented.</i>
<i>You're passionate.</i>

701
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,524
<i>You're smart.</i>

702
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,572
<i>Except in the ways you are really not.</i>
<i>Like not locking your phone.</i>

703
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:12,576
<i>And falling for men like Benji.</i>
<i>You know better, but you can't stop. </i>

704
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,830
<i>Because, well,</i>
<i>because everyone needs someone.</i>

705
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,082
<i>What you really need</i>
<i>is someone to save you.</i>

706
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,419
<i>I can help, Beck.</i>
<i>Let me help you.</i>

707
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,759
[Paco] Joe.

708
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
Pac. Hey.

709
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,473
What's going on?
What're you doing out here?

710
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,016
It's Ron.

711
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,103
He came home drunk.

712
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,397
He started yelling.

713
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,607
Saying I thought I was smart,

714
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,193
reading my books
and looking at him like he's dumb.

715
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,071
What happened? Did he hurt you?

716
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,323
No, he didn't touch me.

717
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,793
I tried to stop him...

718
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,212
-I'm sorry.
-Paco.

719
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,633
Paco, it's okay. Really. It's okay.

720
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,595
You know what? Come with me.
We can fix this together. All right?

721
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,227
So, the first step to fixing something

722
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,899
is to know no matter how destroyed
it seems, it can always be saved.

723
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,737
Books are no exception. You got it?

724
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,155
Got it.

725
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,117
So what we have here is a lying press.
Basically just a huge clamp.

726
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,328
Polyvinyl-acetate glue,

727
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:41,415
means no acid to burn the pages.
Got your needle, thread,

728
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,502
and finally, right out of <i>Bugs Bunny...</i>

729
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,795
a trusty mallet.

730
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,590
You see this?

731
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,094
We don't need this.

732
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,892
[Benji] Johno! Listen to this.

733
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,228
"Dear Benji, heard about your soda.

734
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,688
Am interested in including you
on my fall list of must-tries.

735
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,025
Would love to discuss.
Perhaps even try some? Jeff Pevensey."

736
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,318
That's the dude you're always retweeting?

737
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,654
It's the culture guy
from <i>New York</i> magazine.

738
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,241
Hit him back, bro.

739
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,202
No shit. Back off while I think.

740
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,748
Jeff, comma, so nice to hear
from you, bud, period.

741
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,167
Yeah, our sodas are legit, period.

742
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,420
I would love to meet up
to have you try the goods, period.

743
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,422
Let's set something up.

744
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,972
Scrape carefully along the spine.

745
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,266
Of course,
you've got to watch your fingers.

746
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,727
[cell phone vibrates]

747
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,025
"Sounds great. I can call between meetings
to see if you're available."

748
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,736
This is gonna take us next level.

749
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,862
What time do you think we'll meet?

750
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,617
No offense, we discussed this.

751
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,037
It's best if the product has
one clear face at the beginning.

752
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,914
That's just more me.

753
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,544
[Joe] <i>Okay, the spine is sewn.</i>

754
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,921
So you take this,
pull it as tight as you can, that way.

755
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,799
Yeah. That's it.

756
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:23,892
Jeff!

757
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,979
The glue is set. We've applied the binder.

758
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,063
Now...

759
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:34,653
you gotta be precise,
and use exactly the force needed.

760
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,000
Hey!

761
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,961
Hey, man. Jeff. Nice to meet you, man.

762
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,339
Nice to meet you, too.
Have you been here before?

763
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,549
It's a...
Not a lot of people know about it yet.

764
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,386
It's an incredible after-hours.
Very exclusive.

765
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,056
Yeah, I've been here a couple of times.

766
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,724
-Yeah?
-Hmm.

767
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,934
Oh. Well, good.

768
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,355
So you'll feel right at home, then.

769
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,072
Please, after you.

770
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:19,948
All right.

771
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,915
It's just down. To the left.

772
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,056
Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

773
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,373
[Joe] <i>It's 2:00 p.m. when the door chimes,</i>
<i>and I'm ready.</i>

774
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,921
<i>You told your girlfriends you'd come by.</i>
<i>I know this because I have your phone.</i>

775
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,464
-I'll be back.
-[Joe] Okay.

776
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,299
Hey.

777
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:24,012
Remember me? From almost dying
on the train tracks? [chuckles]

778
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,224
Uh, it rings a bell. Hang on. Hang on.

779
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,226
I wanted to say thank you.

780
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,145
No. You already did that.

781
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,730
Well, uh, thanks again. [chuckles]

782
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,985
And I'm sorry for, uh, running off
the other night.

783
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,321
-You had a guest.
-Hardly.

784
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,118
So, I got you a present.

785
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,661
No, please.
You don't have to get me anything.

786
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,163
Shut up and just look at it.

787
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,005
"Engine, engine number nine
On the New York transit line

788
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,675
If your girl falls on the track
Pick her up, pick her up, pick her up"

789
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,261
[Joe] <i>We already have in-jokes.</i>

790
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,554
So...

791
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,142
anyway, that. And I better--

792
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:15,147
Maybe if you're not too busy,
we could get a drink sometime?

793
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,232
Sure.

794
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,277
Ugh. But I still can't find my phone.

795
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,404
I know. E-mail.

796
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,615
That's right.

797
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,453
See ya, Joe.

798
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,080
See you soon, Beck.

799
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,007
Well played, sir.

800
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,092
Well played.

801
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,514
[Joe] <i>I'm not always right. I'm human.</i>
<i>I make mistakes.</i>

802
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,848
<i>You'll see.</i>

803
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,767
I have to check on a shipment downstairs.

804
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,186
-Can you watch the register?
-Yeah.

805
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,315
[Joe] <i>Hell, maybe</i>
<i>I'm just a fool in love...</i>

806
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,193
<i>but I'm right about you,</i>

807
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,321
<i>and I'm going to help you get</i>
<i>the life you deserve, Beck.</i>

808
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,406
[Benji breathing heavily]

809
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,837
Please.

810
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:25,676
Whatever you think I did,
you got the wrong guy.

811
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,302
No.

812
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,389
I don't.
