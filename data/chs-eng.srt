NETFLIX 原创剧集

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,774
你好
[Joe] <i>Well, hello there.</i>

4
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,943
你是谁？
<i>Who are you?</i>

5
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,320
看你的样子是个学生
<i>Based on your vibe, a student.</i>

6
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,282
你穿着宽松的衬衫
<i>Your blouse is loose.</i>

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,119
你不是来引人注意的 但那些手镯叮当作响
<i>You're not here to be ogled,</i> <i>but those bracelets, they jangle.</i>

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,954
你想要些许关注
<i>You like a little attention.</i>

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,998
好吧 你引起了我的兴趣
<i>Okay, I bite.</i>

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:44,544
你在找书 找小说 首字母从“F”到“K”
<i>You search the books.</i> <i>Fiction, "F" through "K."</i>

11
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,545
好了…
<i>Now...</i>

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,759
你不是那种标准的找福克纳的书 却永远读不到最后的没安全感的女生
<i>Hmm, you're not</i> <i>the standard insecure nymph</i>

13
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>hunting for Faulkner you'll never finish.</i>

14
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,303
健康的肤色说明 你也不读斯蒂芬金的书
<i>Too sun-kissed for Stephen King.</i>

15
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,471
你会买谁的书呢？
<i>Who will you buy?</i>

16
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,057
对不起
[Beck gasps] Sorry.

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:03,021
你听上去很抱歉 好像你为当一个好姑娘而尴尬
[Joe] <i>You sound apologetic,</i> <i>like you're embarrassed to be a good girl,</i>

18
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,690
你低声对我说了第一个词
<i>and you murmur your first word to me.</i>

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,152
你好
Hello.

20
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,278
你在这里工作吗？
Do you work here?

21
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,572
没错
Guilty.

22
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,116
-你要找什么吗？ -宝拉福克斯的书
-Can I help you find something? -Paula Fox.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
挺有眼光
It's a good choice.

24
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,369
被你这么肯定 感觉有点怪
Hmm, I feel weirdly validated.

25
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,456
[chuckles] Follow me.

26
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,456
跟我来吧

27
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,250
（知名作家）

28
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:25,960
她的书在这里
She's gonna be in here.

29
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,547
“知名作家”？ 我以为福克斯没什么名气呢
"Celebrity authors"? I thought Fox was pretty obscure.

30
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,967
她是科特妮洛芙的外婆
She is Courtney Love's maternal grandmother.

31
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,177
你应该不知道
You're not expected to know that.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,887
很好 我不知道
Good. I didn't.

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,224
穆尼先生想把哪怕只有一点出名的 作者的书都放在这里
Mr. Mooney wants anyone in here who's even tangentially famous.

34
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,558
他觉得这样能卖出更多的书
He thinks it sells more books.

35
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,893
真可悲
That's sad.

36
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,728
人们看什么书流行就买什么书
People buying books because of what's popular,

37
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,898
而不是因为他们想在某些方面 被感动或是被改变
and not because they wanna be moved or changed in some way.

38
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,151
对 是有这种风气
Yeah. It's an epidemic.

39
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,031
嗯 你看到这家伙了吗？ 这个 你身后戴眼镜的这个
Yeah, you see this guy? Here, the glasses, behind you.

40
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,118
他刚刚进来时拿了丹布朗最新的小说
He just grabbed Dan Brown's latest on the way in.

41
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,913
所以他会再转上五或十分钟
So he's gonna wander around for another, like, five or ten minutes,

42
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,623
去找一本能装装样子的书一并买下
just to find something legitimate to buy with it.

43
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,626
就像那些买麦片的人 其实是去买安全套的
Oh, like the cereal guys buy when they're really there for condoms.

44
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,629
那只会更明显 还不如敢做敢当
Only makes it more conspicuous. Like, own your shit.

45
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,423
如果丹布朗就是你的心头爱 就坦荡承认吧
If Dan Brown's your kink, then be out about it.

46
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,429
最后 人们真让人失望 对吗？
[scoffs] At the end of the day,

47
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,429
people really are disappointing, aren't they?

48
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,182
有时候他们会让你惊讶
Sometimes they surprise you.

49
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,021
-宝拉福克斯 在最顶层 需要我… -不 我能够到
-Paula Fox. Top shelf. You want me to... -Oh, no, I got it.

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,486
你没穿胸罩吗？
[Joe] <i>Oh. Are you not wearing a bra?</i>

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,655
你想让我注意到
<i>And you want me to notice.</i>

52
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,948
如果是在拍电影
<i>If this was a movie,</i>

53
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:41,494
我会一把抓住你 然后我们会在书堆里做爱
<i>I'd grab you</i> <i>and we'd go at it right in the stacks.</i>

54
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,873
你读过她的小说吗？ 《绝望的人们》 那是她最棒的作品
Have you read her fiction? <i>Desperate Characters, </i>it's her best.

55
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,541
我一直听说那本书
[sighs] That's what I keep hearing.

56
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,793
-你没读过《绝望的人们》？ -我知道
-You haven't read <i>Desperate Characters?</i> -I know. I know.

57
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,670
我担心那书名不符实
I'm worried it's not gonna live up to the hype.

58
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,589
我可以打保票那书跟大家说的一样好
I can safely say it is that good.

59
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,384
这真是很高的认可 虽然是书店工作人员口中说出来的
That's a high endorsement. And from a bookstore clerk, nonetheless.

60
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,052
是书店经理
Well, it's bookstore manager.

61
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,138
喂？这里有工作人员吗？
Hello? Anyone working here?

62
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,682
混蛋
-Asshole. -Mmm...

63
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,435
-Whoa. -[chuckles]

64
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,816
能快点吗？我很着急
Do you mind? Uh, I'm in a hurry.

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,569
他很生气要买本塞林格的书 让自己觉得被尊重
[Joe] <i>He's just pissed he's gotta</i> <i>buy Salinger to feel respectable</i>

66
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,072
而其实他真正想做的是吃奇多 在苹果设备上看黄片手淫
<i>when all he really wants to do</i> <i>is eat Cheetos and jerk it to iPorn</i>

67
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,201
然后再读完丹布朗的书
<i>before washing it all down</i> <i>with a Dan Brown chaser.</i>

68
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,453
祝您今天愉快 先生
Have a nice day, sir.

69
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,001
好了 我决定买这本
Okay, I'm going for it.

70
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,795
-好极了 你不会后悔的 -最好不会
-Good. You won't regret it. -I'd better not.

71
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,505
宝拉福克斯 不错
Paula Fox. Nice.

72
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,175
她是科特妮洛芙的外婆
You know, she was, uh, Courtney Love's maternal grandmother.

73
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,384
所以我才买的
That's why I'm buying it.

74
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,308
你有足够的现金付账 但你想让我知道你的名字
[Joe] <i>You have enough cash to cover this,</i> <i>but you want me to know your name.</i>

75
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,518
-“吉娜薇”？ -是的
-"Guinevere"? -Yeah.

76
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,438
我父母太不会取名了
My parents were assholes with the whole naming thing.

77
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,190
但大家都叫我贝可
But everyone just calls me Beck.

78
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,985
你叫乔伊…
And you're Joe...

79
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,028
戈登伯格
Goldberg.

80
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,989
大家都叫我乔伊
Everyone calls me Joe.

81
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,199
[chuckles]

82
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,037
你不祝我今天愉快吗？
Aren't you gonna tell me to have a nice day?

83
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,039
祝你今天愉快 贝可
You have a nice day, Beck.

84
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,916
也祝你今天愉快 乔伊
You have one yourself, Joe.

85
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,090
你对我微笑 为我说的笑话发笑
[Joe] <i>You smiled, laughed at my jokes,</i>

86
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,177
告诉了我你的名字 问了我的名字
<i>told me your name, asked for mine.</i>

87
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,847
她在上面写她的号码了吗？ 她对你有意思
She write her number on there? She was on you hard.

88
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
不 她只是很友好
No, she was just being nice.

89
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,476
我会立刻去谷歌上搜索她的全部信息
I'd be googling the hell out of her right now.

90
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,519
你知道她的全名了
You know her full name.

91
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,854
那也太积极了 伊森
That's pretty aggressive, Ethan.

92
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,775
我怎么跟你说的？一定要主动出击
What do I tell you? Always be closing that shit.

93
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,946
你需要我的话 我就在烹饪书那一块
[both] If you need me, I'll be in cookbooks.

94
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,699
但我是去工作 不是去玩的 我发誓
But for work. Not for fun. I swear.

95
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,995
最后 人们真让人失望 对吗？
[Joe] <i>At the end of the day, people are</i> <i>really just disappointing, aren't they?</i>

96
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,713
但你是吗 贝可？你是吗？
<i>But are you, Beck? Are you?</i>

97
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,859
是 人们寻找“命中注定的那个人”
<i>Yes, people find "the one." </i>

98
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,321
我相信 我努力做到思想开明
<i>I believe that. I try to stay open.</i>

99
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,074
我也曾恋爱过 她让我心碎了 贝可
<i>I was in love once.</i> <i>She broke my heart, Beck.</i>

100
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,201
她真的伤透了我的心
<i>Ugh, she really did a number on me.</i>

101
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,329
我应该看到那些迹象的
<i>I should've seen the signs.</i>

102
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,540
但我们在恋爱的时候永远看不到
<i>But we never do when we're in love.</i>

103
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,043
例子一 克劳迪亚跟罗恩
<i>-Exhibit A. Claudia and Ron.</i> -[indistinct arguing]

104
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,129
我出去喝了几杯 别追问了
[Ron] I went out for a couple of drinks. Get off my back.

105
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,631
克劳迪亚是个护士 单身母亲
[Joe] <i>Claudia's a nurse. Single parent.</i>

106
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,008
别烦我！你在打电话…
[Claudia] Leave me alone! You're on your phone...

107
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,803
你觉得她恋爱的时候 知道罗恩是个混蛋吗？
[Joe] <i>You think she knew Ron was a shitbag</i> <i>when she fell in love?</i>

108
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,430
不 她那时觉得他是个王子
<i>No, she thought he was a prince.</i>

109
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,140
嘿 帕克
Hey, Paco.

110
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,059

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,896
-她毁掉的不仅是自己的人生 -别烦我！
<i>-hers is not the only life she ruined.</i> -[Claudia] Leave me alone!

113
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,066
为什么回家这么让你心烦？
Why is coming home such a chore for you? [continues indistinctly]

114
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,233
没事吧？
Is everything cool in there?

115
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,361
-没事 妈妈和罗恩只是在说话 -你总是跟你的朋友出去鬼混！
Yeah, Mom and Ron are just talking.

116
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,946
-我受够了！ -哇噢
[Claudia] You always go out with your friends!

117
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,946
-And I'm sick of it! -Wow.

118
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,115
那本书你快看完了 是吗？
You are burning through that book, aren't you?

119
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,118
我读得很快 很好看
Reads quick. It's good.

120
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,369
（《三剑客》）
Let me know when you finish. I'll get you another one.

不了 我妈妈晚点会给我做饭的
Nah. My mom will just make me something later.

128
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,139
真可惜 这个不能放 要被扔掉了
That's a shame. This won't keep. It's getting tossed.

129
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,391
你确定吗 乔伊？
You sure, Joe?

我得确定你是个安全的人

136
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,691
从你的名字开始是最好的
<i>And your name</i> <i>was a glorious place to start.</i>

137
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,818
没多少人叫吉娜薇贝可

找到你了 所有的账号都对公众可见
<i>And there you were.</i> <i>Every account set to public.</i>

139

<i>You want to be seen, heard, known.</i>

140
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,912

你12岁的时候父母离异 你的父亲从此了无音讯
<i>Your folks split when you were 12.</i> <i>Your dad dropped out of the picture.</i>

145
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,472
你上了布朗大学 专业是文学 酷
<i>Went to Brown</i> <i>where you majored in lit. Cool.</i>

146
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,932
辅修人渣课程
<i>And minored in douchebags. Hmm.</i>

147
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,769
然后去了纽约市攻读艺术硕士 大概想要成就一番名气吧
<i>And then on to NYC to conquer an MFA</i> <i>and make your mark, presumably.</i>

148
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,897
你现在还在写作 写得很少
<i>Now you still write. Barely.</i>

149
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,774
太忙碌于过你五年之后 都不会记得的生活了
<i>Too busy living out moments</i> <i>you won't remember five years from now.</i>

150
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,778
我知道 因为你一直 在发布这种生活的点滴
<i>I know this because you post</i> <i>about this life all the goddamn time.</i>

151
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,448
[all speaking indistinctly]

152
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,326
老实说 这是你最没吸引力的部分了 贝可
[Joe] <i>Candidly, it's the least</i> <i>appealing thing about you, Beck.</i>

153
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,413
你在我们相遇几小时后发布了这个
<i>You posted this hours after our encounter.</i>

154
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,413
[camera shutter clicks]

155
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,625
没有提到书店里 那个可爱的家伙 让我担心
[Joe]<i> I was concerned you didn't mention</i> <i>that cute guy in a bookstore.</i>

156
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,503
然后我意识到你的网上人生并不真实
<i>And then I realized</i> <i>your online life isn't real.</i>

157
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,630
这是个…拼贴画
<i>It's a collage.</i>

158
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,840
你拼贴出了这个贝可的生活 这个…
<i>You paste this Beck up. This...</i>

159
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,219
自信、讨喜、可爱、柔韧的小可人
<i>together, lovable, cute,</i> <i>bendy little creature.</i>

160
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,846
如果有什么的话 你没有把我 分享给你的订阅者这件事
<i>If anything, the fact that</i> <i>you didn't share me with your followers</i>

161
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,307
只证实了我们真的有联系
<i>only confirms we really connected.</i>

162
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,894
接着我在网上找到了你的地址
<i>The next thing our little friend</i> <i>the Internet gave me was your address.</i>

163
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,396
（街景-班克街171号）

164
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,695
就是这里 有着无遮挡的大窗户
<i>There it is, with its big, naked windows.</i>

165
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,072
挺好 太好了
<i>It's nice. Too nice.</i>

166
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,699
我想这是拿补贴的校舍
<i>I'm thinking subsidized school housing.</i>

167
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,079
天啊！你好像从来没看过恐怖电影 或是新闻
<i>Jesus! It's like you've never</i> <i>seen a horror movie or the news.</i>

168
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,005
但你想让人们看你 不是吗？
<i>But you want people to watch, don't you?</i>

169
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,132
我计划等我们熟悉之后
<i>You know,</i> <i>I plan on asking you about this quality</i>

170
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,759
问问关于你这项特质的问题
<i>when we get to know each other better.</i>

171
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,302
一个提议
<i>A proposal.</i>

172
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,263
不如我们明天一起共度吧？
<i>Why don't we</i> <i>spend the day together tomorrow?</i>

173
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,556
只有你跟我？
<i>Just you and me?</i>

174
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,684
[Beck] <i>To everyone out there</i> <i>chasing their dreams, don't give up.</i>

175
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,684
“写给那些追逐梦想的人 别放弃”

176
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,770
“同时 享受芝士通心粉吧！”
<i>And in the meantime, mac and cheese!</i>

177
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:30,278
很可爱 没深度 但可爱 你还有更多面吗？让我们发现一下吧
[Joe] <i>It's cute. Not deep. But cute.</i> <i>Is there more to you? Let's find out.</i>

178
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,957
天一破晓 我们的一天就开始了
<i>Our day starts at the ass-crack of dawn.</i>

179
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,585
我从你发布的日程表了解到 你6点半要去教一堂
<i>I know from your posted schedule</i> <i>that you teach a 6:30 class</i>

180
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,378
被称为“起来运动”的课
<i>called Get Up N Flow.</i>

181
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:52,133
你温柔地触碰那些来自苏荷区 双眼无神的肥胖妈妈们汗湿的背部…
<i>You caress the sweaty backs of bulimic,</i> <i>dead-eyed real mommies of SoHo...</i>

182
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,677
我喜欢你今天的线条 塔莎
I am loving your form today, Tasha.

183
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,388
…微笑着说着客套的鼓励的话
[Joe] <i>...offering smiles</i> <i>and lies of encouragement.</i>

184
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,639
[Beck continues indistinctly]

185
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,934
到了10点 你在大学的 浪漫主义课程上当助教
[Joe] <i>By 10:00, you're at campus</i> <i>to TA a Romantics class</i>

186
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,769
给某个教授当助手
<i>and play Vanna White to some shirt.</i>

187
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,688
早上好 莱西教授
Morning, Professor Leahy.

188
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,858
我跟你说过了叫我保罗 你准备好上课了吗？
I told you, it's Paul. Are you ready for class?

189
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,484
教授显然想上你
[Joe] <i>Professor Obvious wants to fuck you.</i>

190
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,739
你很聪明 你让他以为 有一天他会有机会
<i>Now, you're smart.</i> <i>You let him think one day he might.</i>

191
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,073
这样又有什么损失呢 对吧？
<i>And what's the harm in that, right?</i>

192
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,661
下课后 你去你最喜欢的咖啡馆
<i>After class,</i> <i>you head to your favorite café</i>

193
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,289
进行一整天第一次的写作
<i>to write for the first time all day.</i>

194
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,249
但你的生活并不如你所愿
<i>But your life doesn't cooperate.</i>

195
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,420
你有钱的女友们才刚睡醒
<i>Your wealthy girlfriends</i> <i>have just now woken up,</i>

196
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,838
除了策划下一个
<i>and have nothing better to do</i>

197
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,175
可以在社交软件上发布的无聊夜生活 就没有什么好做的了
<i>than plan their next pointless</i> <i>yet instagrammable night.</i>

198
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,010
我们能现实一点吗？
<i>Can we get real for a second?</i>

199
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,095
你交友的品味有问题 贝可
<i>You have questionable taste in friends,</i> <i>Beck.</i>

200
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,312
-干杯！ -耶！
-[all] Cheers! -Yeah!

201
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,939
-对了 生日快乐！ -太感谢了
-Oh, yes. Happy birthday! -[Annika laughs] Thank you so much.

202
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,610
生活中买的东西太昂贵了
[Joe] <i>And expensive taste in lives.</i>

203
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,195
-准备好了吗？ -谢谢
-Ready? -Thank you.

204
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,865
你喜欢吗？
-[gasps] -Do you like it?

205
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,160
不 我不喜欢 我当然喜欢了！
No, I hate it. Of course I love it!

206
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,745
杰森都不给她买那么好的内衣
Jason didn't even get her something that nice,

207
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,622
安妮卡最后就让他爆菊了
and Annika finally let him do anal.

208
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,667
-我的天！ -拜托 那是时候到了
-[Lynn] Oh, my God! -Please, please, it was time.

209
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,920
接下来请打开我的礼物 告诉我你有多讨厌我 姑娘
Please open my gift next and tell me how much you hate me then, lady.

210
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,800
[Annika gasps]

211
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,513
一只蝴蝶？ 这是我的年度灵兽 你记得？
A butterfly? It's my spirit animal for the year. You remembered?

212
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,348
只是因为你一直喋喋不休地提到它
Only 'cause you wouldn't shut up about it.

213
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,351
你非常想要融入她们
[Joe]<i> You want so badly to be one of them.</i>

214
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,727
-生日快乐 -你看起来真漂亮
-[Beck] Happy birthday. -[Annika] You look so beautiful.

215
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,104
她们之后就无事可做了
[Joe] <i>Well, they've got nothing to do</i> <i>after this.</i>

216
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,023
对 她们会开派对直到凌晨5点 然后明天再一起聚会
<i>So, yeah, they'll party till 5:00</i> <i>and scrape it together tomorrow.</i>

217
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,567
但你不行 你得要为谋生而工作
<i>But you can't.</i> <i>You have to work for a living.</i>

218
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,238
麦昆牌的 贝可？多少钱？
A McQueen, Beck? How much was it?

219
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,864
是清仓商品
[chuckles] It was on clearance.

220
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
麦昆2010年上吊后
They haven't put a McQueen scarf on clearance

221
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,618
围巾就没有清仓出售过了
since he hung himself in 2010.

222
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
就算她值得也太贵了
It'd be too much even if she did deserve it,

223
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,539
何况她不值得
which she does not.

224
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,958
你的朋友并不全是笨蛋
[Joe]<i> Hmm. Not all your friends are dumb.</i>

225
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,418
你总是这样
[Peach] You always do this.

226
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,046
你大手笔地买 你买不起的东西 因为…
You make, like, a big gesture that you can't afford because...

227
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,218
-抱歉 你人太好了 -没什么大不了的 我有礼品卡
-[scoffs] I'm sorry, you're too nice. -It's no big deal. I had, um, a gift card.

228
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,595
你有多缺钱？
How broke are you?

229
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,349
告诉我怎么回事
Just tell me what's up.

230
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,976
听上去她其实很在乎你
[Joe] <i>Actually sounds like she cares.</i>

231
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,853
听着 我很感激…
[Beck] Look, I appreciate--

232
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,564
你为什么不让我借你点现金呢？
[Peach] Why don't you just let me loan you some cash?

233
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,566
好吗？我一直跟你说 这没什么
Okay? I keep telling you, it's nothing.

234
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,151
同时 听上去还很居高临下
[Joe] <i>Also, sounds condescending.</i>

235
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,905
你知道我愿意为你做一切事情 别忘记了
You know I'd do anything for you. Don't forget that.

236
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,201
-确定不跟我们出去玩吗？ -我得写作
-Sure you can't come out with us? -I gotta write.

237
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,036
好姑娘 晚点聊吧？
Virtuous. Catch you later?

238
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,169
那是你最好的朋友了吗？
[Joe] <i>Is that the best friend you've got?</i>

239
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,422
如果是的话 贝可 你真的很孤独
<i>If so, Beck, you really are alone.</i>

240
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,934
你的社交媒体编造出了一个谎言
<i>Your social media's a liar.</i>

241
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,271
你在上面表现成 一个逍遥自在的业余文学爱好者
<i>It says</i> <i>you're a happy-go-lucky dilettante.</i>

242
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,943
但在一切表象之下 你似乎是有真材实料的
<i>But, underneath it all,</i> <i>you seem like the genuine article.</i>

243
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,447
注意力缺失 当然 但一旦关上门…
<i>Stretched ADD thin, sure,</i> <i>but as soon as the door closes...</i>

244
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,782
你又回到了键盘前 想要努力写作
<i>you're back at the keyboard,</i> <i>trying to write.</i>

245
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,369
[cell phone vibrates]

246
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,584
[sighs]

247
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,803
谢谢
[man] Thanks.

248
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,600
不用找了 伙计
Keep the change, man.

249
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,772
嘿 让我上去
Hey. Let me up.

250
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,234
贝可 这人到底是谁？
[Joe] <i>Uh, Beck, who the fuck is this?</i>

251
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,078
我最好的朋友看到 你在我带你去的派对上
My best friend walked in on you getting your dick sucked

252
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,998
在洗手间里 让一个陌生女人帮你口交！
by some random woman in a bathroom at a party that I took you to!

253
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,042
我喝醉了 我都没射精
I was wasted. I didn't even finish.

254
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,504
你就这么道歉？“我没到高潮” 那是你要说的话吗？
That's your apology? "I didn't cum." That's the one you're going with?

255
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,047
我显然不应该跟除你之外的
I obviously shouldn't have gone in the bathroom

256
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,298
任何女孩去洗手间
with any girl that wasn't you.

257
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:05,261
但她说她有上好的可卡因 我压力一直非常大
But she said she had good coke, and I'd been seriously stressed.

258
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,180
我跟乔诺开始做这行时
I thought, when Johno and I started our line,

259
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,099
我以为就会是挑选一下口味之类的
it was gonna be like picking out flavors and shit.

260
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,185
结果是16个小时 关于微生物管理的演讲
It turns out it's 16-hour lectures on microbial management.

261
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,771
那就是为什么没有人 开自己的手工汽水公司
And that's why no one starts their own artisanal soda company,

262
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,566
还有为什么美国人 一直得喝让自己得癌症的垃圾
and why America has to keep drinking crap that's giving 'em cancer.

263
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,570
你竟然把你的口交外遇 跟治愈癌症联系起来了
You actually managed to connect your illicit blowjob to curing cancer.

264
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,406
真是了不起
I'm genuinely impressed.

265
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,910
贝可 我…
Beck, I...

266
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,664
讲真的 我现在工作很忙
Seriously, I am drowning in work.

267
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:38,085
我没时间一直跟你乱搞 或是做什么你擅长的事
I don't have time to keep hooking up or whatever it is you're even capable of.

268
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,965
我知道我做了些蠢事 但我现在改了
I know I've done some stupid shit, but I'm on it now.

269
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,262
我不想只跟你上床而已
I don't wanna be just some guy you sleep with.

270
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,684
天啊 你让我疯狂了
[whispering] God, you make me insane.

271
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,859
厉害了 贝可 看上去真是个理想对象
[Joe] <i>Way to go, Beck.</i> <i>Looks like a catch.</i>

272
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,157
本杰明J阿什比三世 有三个同名的
<i>Benjamin J. Ashby III.</i> <i>Oh, there's three of them.</i>

273
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,200
出生在格林威治 上的是寄宿学校
<i>Greenwich-born, boarding-school bred.</i>

274
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,579
他的爸爸是阿什比经纪行的本阿什比
<i>His father is the Ben Ashby</i> <i>of Ashby Brokerage.</i>

275
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,373
做过两份失败的工作 模特 天啊
<i>Two failed careers. Model. Oh, boy.</i>

276
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,833
还有一个约会软件的联合创始人
<i>And co-creator of a dating app </i>

277
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,337
是一个通过音乐品味把人 关联起来的软件 叫做“恋爱交友”
<i>that connects people</i> <i>through musical tastes called LoveHooks.</i>

278
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,131
现在是手工饮料家庭汽水的 首席执行官
<i>Current CEO of Home Soda</i> <i>Artisanal Beverages.</i>

279
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,132
座右铭…
<i>Motto... </i>

280
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,509
“用手喝更好” 这话毫无意义
<i>"Drink better by hand,"</i> <i>which makes no sense,</i>

281
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,844
但放在一个穿着价值六百美元
<i>but evokes a homespun quality</i>

282
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,222
日本运动鞋的家伙身上 有种朴素的感觉
<i>that lines up with a guy</i> <i>who wears $600 Japanese sneakers.</i>

283
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:37,061
发型、他想要通过转发“黑人的命 也是命”的推文隐藏的特权
<i>The hair, the privilege he tries to hide</i> <i>with retweets of Black Lives Matter.</i>

284
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,649
不想听上去像是批判别人 但这家伙就跟美国精神完全格格不入
<i>Not to sound judgey, but this guy</i> <i>is everything wrong with America.</i>

285
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,903
所以我要调查
<i>See, this is why I do my research.</i>

286
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,863
你爱上了错的人
<i>You fall for the wrong men.</i>

287
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,531
坏男人们
<i>Bad men.</i>

288
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,076
你让他们进你家 你让他们伤害你
<i>You let them in. You let them hurt you.</i>

289
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,662
还不能确定 但我猜
<i>Too far away to know for sure,</i> <i>but my guess is,</i>

290
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,455
要是他有一点可能让你高潮
<i>if he came anywhere close</i> <i>to making you cum,</i>

291
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,791
你就会做出百老汇水平的表演
<i>you would've made a Broadway show</i> <i>out of it.</i>

292
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,126
但你没有 因为他没那能耐
<i>But you didn't, 'cause he didn't. </i>

293
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,378
[exhales]

294
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,879
（《绝望的人们》 小说 宝拉福克斯著）

295
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,677
-《绝望的人们》 -是的 我刚买的
<i>-"Desperate Characters."</i> -Yeah, I just got it.

296
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,553
我读完了可以借给你 这应该是她写得最好的一部
Borrow it when I'm done. It's supposed to be her best.

297
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,138
我们请的乔诺的顾问
Johno's consultant we brought in,

298
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,140
她一直在跟我说这种东西
she's been all over me about this kind of thing.

299
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,892
烧些东西让办公室充满正能量
Saged the crap out of the office.

300
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,312
书名里有“绝望”两字
The book title has the word "desperate" in it.

301
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,273
但你别觉得自己是个绝望的人 贝可
You don't want to think of yourself as a desperate character, Beck.

302
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,987
因为你正相反 宝贝
Because you're the opposite, babe.

303
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,447
你是我认识最聪明的姑娘
You're the smartest girl I know.

304
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,367
老实说 我为你着迷
Honestly, you blow me away.

305
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,747
[cell phone vibrating]

306
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,875
该死 该走了 乔诺一直在给我打电话
Oh, shit. Gotta roll. Johno's blowing up my phone.

307
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,462
嘿 你应该来办公室试尝一些新口味
Hey, you should come by the office, test out some new flavors.

308
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,382
我们开发出了孜然口味 我知道你有多喜欢印度菜
We're doing cumin. I know how much you like Indian food.

309
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,676
当然好 听上去很好
Sure. Sounds good.

310
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,594
另外 你胖了点
It looks good on you, by the way.

311
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,056
看上去不错
The extra weight.

312
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,729
对 嘿 我来了 兄弟
Yeah. Hey. I'm on my way, bro.

313
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,188
你们点了批萨？
You guys ordering pizzas?

314
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,150
对 别像上次那样坑我了 要不含麸质的脆皮
Yeah, don't dick me over like last time. Gluten-free crust.

315
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,902
别从那家素食店订 素食芝士吃起来跟屎一样
Not from that vegan place. Vegan cheese tastes like asshole.

316
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,738
[door opens and closes]

317
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,415
我说的是法国美食
[door closes]

318
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,415
[Benji] I'm talking French gourmet shit.

319
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,002
不 乔诺 听我说
No. Johno. Johno. Listen to me.

320
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,629
他们做不了一半不含麸质的 因为那是生面团
They can't do half-gluten-free 'cause it's dough.

321
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,298
他们得用斯佩尔特小麦粉做的面团
They have to use a spelt dough.

322
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,161
所以你还没满足
[Joe] <i>So you didn't finish.</i>

323
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,205
[breathing heavily]

324
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,008
[gasps]

325
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,151
[breathing heavily]

326
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,821
就这样
Just like that.

327
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,379
谢谢 你真好
Thank you. You're so kind. [chuckles]

328
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,006
你能帮我叫辆出租车吗？
I don't suppose you can help me get a cab, can you?

329
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,967
当然可以
Of course.

330
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,468
-谢谢 -嗯
-Thanks. -Yeah.

331
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,987
[Claudia moaning]

332
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,073
哇噢 别告诉我说你已经读完了
Wow. Don't tell me you're finished already.

333
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,283
差不多了
Almost.

334
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,701
太好看了
It's so good.

335
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,911
但有时候对话很奇怪
Sometimes the dialogue's weird, though.

336
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,581
像是他们要杀掉彼此的时候 还很客气
Like when they're killing each other and still all nice about it.

337
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,709
那是19世纪 人们还是很礼貌的
Well, it was the 19th century. People still had manners.

338
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,254
我希望我们能去再拿一本
I was hoping we could go get another one.

339
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,550
已经很晚了 帕克 我不知道
[sighs] I mean, it's pretty late, Pac. I don't know.

340
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,760
[Claudia moaning] Oh, yeah.

341
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,760
是啊

342
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,013
我想让你高潮…
I want you to cum...

343
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,642
今晚很有气氛 贝可 因为除了我之外的所有人都在做爱
[Joe] <i>Something's</i> <i>in the air tonight, Beck,</i>

344
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,642
<i>'cause everyone but me is getting action.</i>

345
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,895
就连爱情鸟都在交配
<i>Even the lovebirds made up.</i>

346
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,647
嗯 为什么不去呢？当然要去了
Yeah. Yeah, why not? Sure.

347
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,611
你知道仲马是个黑人吗？ 我上谷歌搜索他了
[Paco] Did you know Dumas was a black dude? I googled him.

348
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,655
他的祖母是个奴隶 他的父亲是个准将
His grandmother was a slave, and his dad was a brigadier general.

349
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,407
他杀了半个营的人
He killed like half a battalion.

350
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,493
你在书店工作 可能已经知道了
You probably knew that since you work at a bookstore.

351
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,120
我不知道
I didn't.

352
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,706
-你怎么会在这里工作呢？ -在我比你大一点的年纪时
-How'd you get to work here, anyway? -Mr. Mooney gave me a job

353
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,250
穆尼先生给了我这份工作 他像是收留了我
when I was just a little older than you. He sort of took me in.

354
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,252
-他似乎是个好人 -他是个混蛋
-He seems nice. -He's a dick.

355
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,381
但他爱书 他也教会了我爱书
But he loved books, and he taught me to love them, too.

356
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,716
我从没见他来过这里
I never see him around here.

357
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,594
-他死了吗？ -不 他只是老了
-Is he dead? -No. He's just old.

358
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,887
对不起 帕克
I'm sorry, Pac.

359
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,348
我留了一本给你的 但伊森一定卖掉了
I had one back here for you, but Ethan must've sold it.

360
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,100
-卖了什么？ -你下一本要读的书
-Sold what? -Your next read.

361
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,852
来吧 我让你看看我们放好书的地方
Come on. I'll show you where we keep the good stuff.

362
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,411
真奇特
[Paco] Freaky.

363
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,293
这是个笼子
It's the Cage.

364
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,255
是我们放早期版本跟收藏的地方
It's where we keep early editions and collectibles.

365
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,881
很冷
It's cold.

366
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,259
18度 用于保存书籍的
Sixty-five degrees. For the books.

367
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,719
要是僵尸来了 我要藏在这里
If the zombies come, this is where I'm hiding.

368
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,722
不如把那杯奶昔放下吧？
Why don't you set that milkshake down?

369
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,202
小心 约瑟夫
[Mooney] <i>Careful, Joseph.</i>

370
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:32,708
书的价值完全在于其保存状态 我来告诉你
When it comes to the value of a book, it's all about condition. I'll show you.

371
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,084
温度一直是18度
[Joe] <i>It's always 65 degrees.</i>

372
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,797
40%的湿度 太潮的话 书页会发霉…
Humidity 40%. Too moist, the pages can mildew...

373
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,465
太干的话就会变脆
[Mooney] <i>Too dry, they get brittle.</i>

374
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,759
一直要让书直立
Always keep books upright

375
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,054
书脊就不会卷起来或是变弯 或是我们说的“翘起来”
so the spines don't become rolled or warped or what we call "cocked."

376
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,224
永远不要折书页
And we never wanna fold or crease the pages.

377
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,019
用不含化学成分的抹布 拂去封面的灰尘
And we dust the covers with a chemical-free duster.

378
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,603
拿的时候一直拿书脊柱
Always towards the spine.

379
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,065
这间屋子里不能进阳光
Under no circumstances is there any sunlight in this room.

380
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,401
阳光会像火一样快地把书给毁掉
Sunlight can ruin a book as fast as fire.

381
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,944
比火更快
Faster.

382
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,865
为了保存好一些老书 要记的东西真多
That's a lot of stuff to remember just to take care of some old books.

383
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,827
生活中最有价值的东西通常是…
The most valuable things in life are usually...

384
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
最无助的
the most helpless.

385
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,626
所以需要像我们一样的人 去保护它们 知道吗？
So they need people like us to protect them. You know?

386
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,301
“堂肯德鸡”
<i>"Don Quicks-oat."</i>

387
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,054
是吉诃德 说的是一个信奉骑士精神的人
<i>Quixote.</i> It's about a guy who believes in chivalry,

388
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,972
他决定当一个老派的骑士
so he decides to be an old-school knight.

389
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,140
什么是骑士精神？
What's chivalry?

390
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,602
是用尊敬的态度对待别人 特别是女人 像男人们应该做的那样
It's treating people with respect. Especially women. Like men should.

391
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,312
是本好书 是我最爱的书之一
It's good. It's one of my favorites.

392
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,023
我可能不应该拿这本回家
I probably shouldn't take this home.

393
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,649
这不是第一版 只是旧版
It's not a first edition, it's just an old one.

394
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,276
再说了 我信任你
Besides, I trust you.

395
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,463
-你去哪了 帕克？ -我们只是去买奶昔了
-Where you been, Paco? -We just grabbed some milkshakes.

396
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,966
-你刚跟陌生人走了？ -乔伊不是陌生人
-You just walk off with strangers? -Joe's not a stranger.

397
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,259
是 他是
Yes, he is.

398
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,261
快进去 好吗？
Inside. Now. Okay?

399
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,188
离我女朋友的孩子远点
Keep away from my girlfriend's kid.

400
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,317
对不起 但他刚刚在外面 让他听到你们在里面的动静不大好吧
Look, I'm sorry, but he was out here, and he could hear everything in there.

401
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,610
别教我怎么养育孩子
Don't you tell me how to parent.

402
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,655
这套装好人的行为 在其他人身上可能管用
This whole nice guy act might work on other people.

403
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,699
我当假释官当了15年 我能看出你是什么货色
I'm a parole officer, 15 years, and I can see what you are.

404
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,202
你是个打女人的酒鬼
[Joe] <i>Well, you're an alcoholic shitbag</i> <i>who beats women.</i>

405
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,454
所以拜托来开导我吧
<i>So, please, enlighten me.</i>

406
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,581
你是个怪胎
You're a freak.

407
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,584
离帕克远点 不然的话
So, stay away from Paco, because if you don't,

408
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,962
我会拿把牛排刀把你的眼睛挖出来
I'll grab a steak knife and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

409
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,716
世界上有可怕的人 贝可
[Joe] <i>There are scary people</i> <i>in the world, Beck.</i>

410
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,677
所以保证安全很重要
<i>That's why it's important to be safe.</i>

411
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,434
以及为什么我要做我将要做的事
<i>And why I have to do what I'm about to do.</i>

412
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,026
有趣的事情
<i>Fun fact.</i>

413
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,698
你知道法律要求要调查煤气泄漏吗？
<i>Did you know the law requires</i> <i>gas leaks to be investigated?</i>

414
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,241
我见到你之后学到了很多
<i>I've been learning a lot since I met you.</i>

415
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,493
嘿 贝可？你又没关门
Hey, Beck? You left the door open again.

416
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,620
我以为我们说好了 不会再发生这种事了
I thought we said we weren't gonna do that anymore.

417
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,582
我很小心地在你一整天都有事的时候 打给了煤气公司
<i>I was careful to call the gas company</i> <i>on a day when you had a full schedule.</i>

418
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,916
我不想吓到你
<i>I wouldn't wanna scare you.</i>

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,793
嘿 贝可在家吗？
Hey. Is Beck here?

420
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,212
不在 管理员让我进来的 有人说这里有煤气泄漏
Nope. Super let me in. Someone reported a leak.

421
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,131
对 嗯 她提到过 没事吧？
Right. Yeah. She mentioned that. Is everything okay?

422
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,884
对 没问题 告诉你女朋友没有泄漏
Yeah, all clear. Tell your girlfriend there's no leak.

423
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,468
我弄完了 所以…
I'm done, so...

424
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,762
好的 谢谢 我来锁门
Okay. Thanks. Well, I can just lock up.

425
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,978
我只是需要知道你到底是什么样的人
<i>I just need to know who you really are.</i>

426
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,813
除了是一个住在
<i>Besides a broke poetry student</i>

427
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,441
你永远租不起的校舍里 写诗的穷学生外
<i>in a subsidized apartment</i> <i>you could never afford.</i>

428
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,610
在哪里 贝可？
<i>Where is it, Beck?</i>

429
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,905
我们住在一起后 你家就不会像个猪窝了
<i>When we live together,</i> <i>your place won't be a pigsty. </i>

430
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,031
我可以打扫
<i>I'll clean for us. </i>

431
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,912
你不会吃这些速冻垃圾食品了 我每天都会为你下厨 我保证
<i>And you won't eat all this frozen shit.</i> <i>I'll cook for you every day. I promise.</i>

432
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,377
我甚至会帮你洗衣服
<i>I'll even do your laundry.</i>

433
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,465
呵护你最爱的书
<i>And take care of your favorite books.</i>

434
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,220
我每天早上都会整理床单
<i>I'll make our bed every morning.</i>

435
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,514
在这里
<i>Oh, there it is.</i>

436
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,183
不管你多抗拒我
<i>And no matter how hard you fight me,</i>

437
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,062
我都永远会确保 你的密码能保护你的电脑
<i>I will always make sure</i> <i>you password protect your devices.</i>

438
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,735
“一天 你将不再需要爱
[Leahy] <i>"One day</i> <i>You won't need love anymore</i>

439
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,404
一天 你将不再在这世界上行走
<i>One day, you won't walk through the world</i>

440
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,782
好像让一切停下是你的工作
<i>As though it was your job</i> <i>To hold everything up</i>

441
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,619
太阳、天空 黑夜里最难的部分”
The sun, the sky The hard part of the night"

442
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,746
很棒
It's good.

443
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,290
非常棒
It's quite good.

444
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,378
但是贝可 其它的呢？ 你还欠我20页
But, Beck, where's the rest? You owe me 20 more pages.

445
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:51,132
[sighs] I've been, honestly, working every day, and grading papers--

446
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,132
老实说 我每天都在工作 给论文打分…

447
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,051
如果时间安排不过来 就做回兼职生吧
If the schedule is too rigorous, drop back to part-time.

448
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,803
那我就不够资格当助教了
But then I won't qualify to TA.

449
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,430
我需要现金付房租 我会无家可归的
I need the cash. The housing. I'd lose my place.

450
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,516
你会搞定的 你很聪明 不然你就不会到这里来了
You'll figure it out. You're smart, or you wouldn't be here.

451
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,643
-拜托 莱西教授… -叫我保罗
-Please, Professor Leahy-- -Paul.

452
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,981
保罗 我会在这周结束前 把文稿给您的
Paul. I'll get you the pages by the end of the week.

453
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,651
我不能做兼职 好吗？
I can't go to part-time, okay?

454
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,572
我对你期待很高
[sighs] I'm rooting for you.

455
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,492
你需要加把劲
You just need to keep up.

456
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,371
很乐意跟你进一步讨论一下 找一天放学之后的晚上
Happy to discuss further. After class some evening.

457
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,832
如果我们要认真讨论诗歌 就应该边喝边聊
If we're gonna seriously discuss poetry, it should be over a drink.

458
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,959
有一家我很喜欢的美食酒吧…
There's a little gastropub I love...

459
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,753
我很愿意去 保罗
I would love that, Paul. [chuckles]

460
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,173
只是 你的妻子会有什么感觉…
Just, uh, how would your wife feel about you--

461
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,886
关于我帮助一个有抱负的作家吗？ 她很明白 我一向这么慷慨
About me helping out an aspiring writer? She's used to my generosity.

462
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,138
[chuckles]

463
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,931
那就周四晚上吧？
[Leahy] So, Thursday night, then?

464
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,435
就周四晚上吧
Thursday night it is.

465
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,436
好极了
Excellent.

466
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,815
别为接下来几天担心 回家准备吧
And don't worry about the next few days. Just go home and get caught up.

467
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,369
“今晚需要见你”
[Beck] <i>Need to see you tonight.</i>

468
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,958
“如果可以的话 宝贝 我会工作到很晚”
[Benji] <i>Will if I can, babe.</i> <i>Working late.</i>

469
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,295
“另外 我还是能在手指上 闻到你的味道”
<i>P.S., I can still smell you on my fingers.</i>

470
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,215
通过彻底查看你的电脑 我知道了两样决定性的事情
[Joe] <i>I learned two definitive things</i> <i>by scouring your computer.</i>

471
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,428
首先 没有看到你父亲的近照 因为他死了
<i>First, there are no recent pictures</i> <i>of your dad because he's dead. </i>

472
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,264
他吸毒过量 是你发现了他的尸体
<i>He OD'd and you were the one</i> <i>that found him.</i>

473
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,226
你开始写了几首关于那天的诗 但你一直没有写完
<i>You've started a few poems about that day,</i> <i>but you never finished them.</i>

474
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,228
我很抱歉 贝可
<i>I'm so sorry, Beck.</i>

475
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,274
但这一切都不重要 因为我有了第二个最重要的发现
<i>But none of this matters because of</i> <i>my second and greatest discovery. </i>

476
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,652
上午11点06分 我们在书店相遇的一个小时后
<i>11:06 a.m., an hour after</i> <i>our encounter at the bookstore,</i>

477
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,448
在一次讨论用草药蒸法 清洁阴道的好处的群聊中 你写道…
<i>amidst a group text on the merits</i> <i>of vaginal detoxing, you wrote...</i>

478
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,660
“哇 刚遇到了一个 真正会阅读的男人”
[Beck] <i>Wow. Just met a human male</i> <i>who actually reads.</i>

479
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,287
“大家注意”
<i>Alert the media.</i>

480
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,207
“也许我终于是时候 要跟适合我的人约会了？”
<i>What if it's finally time for me</i> <i>to date someone good for me?</i>

481
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,960
谢谢你让我知道我并不是疯了
[Joe] <i>Thank you for letting me know</i>

482
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,960
<i>-I wasn't crazy after all.</i> -[door unlocks]

483
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,878
不！
[Joe]<i> No!</i>

484
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,507
对 我记得你上次寄钱来时说过什么
Yes, I remember what you said when you sent money last.

485
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,259
对 我很感激
Yes, I'm grateful.

486
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,932
我一直在工作 没有更便宜的地方住了
[scoffs] I'm working constantly. There's no place cheaper to live.

487
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,105
我有 他基本上是提议让我跟他上床
I did. He basically offered to sleep with me.

488
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,315
不 我不能举报他 不能那样
No, I can't report him. That's not how it works.

489
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,526
我不担心 我看过足够多的爱情喜剧
[Joe] <i>I'm not worried.</i> <i>I've seen enough romantic comedies</i>

490
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,237
知道像我这样的家伙 总是会陷入这种窘境
<i>to know guys like me</i> <i>are always getting in jams like this.</i>

491
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,323
不是学校 是社会 社会不是这样混的
Not the school, the world. That's not how the world works.

492
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,745
我知道你帮了我多少 只是… 我处境很困难 妈妈
I know how much you helped me, it's just... It's hard here, Mom.

493
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,873
[sighs]

494
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,419
好吧 我会搞定的
Okay. I'll figure it out.

495
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,587
好了 我也爱你
All right. Love you, too.

496
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,047
再见 妈妈
Bye, Mom.

497
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,052
[crying]

498
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,727
没事的 贝可
[Joe] <i>It's okay, Beck.</i>

499
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,483
[cell phone ringing]

500
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,404
嗨 贝可
<i>Hi, Becks.</i>

501
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,073
嘿 贱人 你在哪？来玩吧！
<i>Hey, bitch, where you at? Come play!</i>

502
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,617
我不能去 今天是我最糟糕的一天
I can't. I just had the worst day.

503
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,661
-发生什么事了？ -贝可小甜心 不管什么事
<i>-What happened?</i> <i>-Aw. Beckalicious, whatever it is,</i>

504
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,912
没什么我们解决不了的 好吗？
<i>there's nothing that we can't fix, okay?</i>

505
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,416
-对 我们还有很多酒 -我的天 有打折！
<i>Yes, us and copious amounts of alcohol.</i>

506
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,167
-[Peach] <i>Oh, my God. There's a sale!</i> -[chuckles]

507
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,710
[sighs]

508
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,337
-你们爱我吗？ -当然爱了
-You guys love me? -[Peach]<i> Of course.</i>

509
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,422
-你怎么会说这种话呢？ -那好吧
-[Lynn]<i> Why would you even say that?</i> -[Beck] Okay, then.

510
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,466
到绿点见面吧
Meet me in Greenpoint.

511
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,469
听着 不如你过来吧？好吗？过来
<i>Look, why don't you come here?</i> <i>Okay? Come here.</i>

512
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,053
-我们在的地方其实很好玩 -不行
[Lynn]<i> It's actually really fun</i> <i>where we are.</i>

513
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,513
-我保证 -对
-No. -[Lynn]<i> I promise.</i>

514
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,807
我有些要为自己做的事
[Peach] <i>Yeah.</i>

515
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,807
There's something I need to do for myself.

516
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,725
我在路上给你们发短信
I'll text you on my way.

517
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,809
一会儿见
<i>See you soon.</i>

518
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,727
-再见！ -再见！
<i>-Bye!</i> <i>-Bye!</i>

519
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,188
该死！
[sighs] Fuck!

520
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,694
我想我们要去绿点了 贝可
[Joe] <i>I guess we're going</i> <i>to Greenpoint, Beck.</i>

521
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,952
[woman singing and playing guitar]

522
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,789
我从没去过绿点
<i>I never go to Greenpoint.</i>

523
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,749
但为爱会做傻事 对吗？
<i>But the things you do for love, right?</i>

524
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,753
嗨 好 我们再来几杯
[Beck] Hi. Um, okay, we're gonna get a few more drinks.

525
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,962
等等 等一下
Hold on, one second.

526
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,714
各位？
Guys?

527
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,841
她在想什么？
[Peach] What is she thinking?

528
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,220
开放麦克风是为模特兼歌手 兼歌曲作家兼素食主义者准备的
Open mics are for models-slash- singer-songwriters-slash-vegans.

529
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,221
这些人不想听
These people don't want to hear

530
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,182
某个想要成功的人 读什么关于凄惨生活的诗之类的
some wannabe read a poem about the bleakness of life or whatever.

531
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:13,686
你的朋友不靠谱 那个皮琪是最不靠谱的
[Joe] <i>Your friends are disloyal.</i> <i>And that Peach is the worst.</i>

532
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,356
[laughing]

533
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,150
再来一轮腌菜盐水酒
-[yells] Ooh. -Another round of picklebacks.

534
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,611
贝可宝贝 要挑今晚吗？
Beckish, do we think now's the night?

535
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,154
是的
Positive.

536
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,448
我最近的生活都是在挣扎求生
All of my life lately has been about surviving.

537
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,743
我需要提醒自己我最初来这里的原因
I need to remind myself why I came here in the first place.

538
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,828
-对 -对
-Yes. -Yeah.

539
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,496
-去吧 好耶 -你一直在给谁发短信？
-You go. So good. -Who do you keep texting?

540
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,122
我邀请了本吉
I invited Benji.

541
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,000
-贝可… -什么？他喜欢诗
-Beck... -What? He likes poetry.

542
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,836
-当然 -他发短信说他要来？
-For sure. -And he texted he was coming?

543
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,091
他差不多45分钟前 发了一串微笑的表情
He texted a row of smile emojis, like, 45 minutes ago.

544
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,552
有些男人就是混蛋 你得明白这点
Some guys are assholes, and you just have to realize that.

545
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,845
我知道 皮琪
I get it, Peach.

546
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,806
是你跟我说要一直提醒你 他是个王八蛋的
You're the one who told me to keep reminding you he's a bastard.

547
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,892
接下来有请吉娜薇贝可
Up next, we have Guinevere Beck.

548
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,185
Whoo!

549
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,062

To vulnerability and shit!

551
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,649

555
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:10,034

你起身去开门 但他不在门口
Rise to answer the door But he's not there

567
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,858
因为那是你内心的声音
Because that sound is coming From inside you

568
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,361
你无法去应答 哪怕你进入内心深处
And you cannot answer it No matter how far in you go"

569
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,243
Whoo!

570
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:56,205
你就像脆弱的孩子 爱着帅气的霸凌者一样爱着他
"You loved him the way Fragile kids love gorgeous bullies

571

你为什么这么难过？你太难过了
[man] Why're you so sad? You're just so sad.

576

换点高兴的东西可能会更好
Just something happier, for a change, might be nice.

577

最重要的是 像本吉那样的男人
<i>most of all, men like Benji,</i>

584
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,376
所有这些的共同点就是 他们永远不会也爱你

585
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,336

00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,195
我一定是把它落在地铁上了
-I must've dropped it in the subway. -Oh.

702
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,241
好吧 或者给我你的手机号也行
Uh, okay, well. Just maybe give me your number,

703
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,826
等你有新手机我们就能联系了
for when you get a replacement.

704
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,329
我主要是发邮件
I'm basically enslaved to e-mail.

705
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,291
我懂 聪明 我其实就是个陌生人 怎么小心都不为过
[Joe] <i>I get it. Smart. I'm practically</i> <i>a stranger. Can't be too careful.</i>

706
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,584

Okay.

707
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,587

00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,095
谢谢
Thank you.

711
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,476
-这就是我这周了解到的 -抱歉我没赶到
[Joe] <i>Here's what I learned this week.</i>

712
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,476
[Benji] Sorry I didn't make it, you know?

713
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,146
你很特别 你有才华 你有激情
[Joe] <i>You are special. You're talented.</i> <i>You're passionate.</i>

714
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,524
你很聪明
<i>You're smart.</i>

715
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,572
只是在有些方面 你真的不聪明 像是你不锁手机
<i>Except in the ways you are really not.</i> <i>Like not locking your phone.</i>

716
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:12,576
还有爱上像本吉这种男人 你更清楚 但你停不下来
<i>And falling for men like Benji.</i> <i>You know better, but you can't stop. </i>

717
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,830
因为 每个人都需要另一个人
<i>Because, well,</i> <i>because everyone needs someone.</i>

718
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,082
你真正需要的是找个人拯救你
<i>What you really need</i> <i>is someone to save you.</i>

719
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,419
我能帮忙 贝可 让我帮你
<i>I can help, Beck.</i> <i>Let me help you.</i>

720
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,759
乔伊
[Paco] Joe.

721
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
帕克 嘿
Pac. Hey.

722
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,473
怎么了？你在这里干什么？
What's going on? What're you doing out here?

723
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,016
是罗恩
It's Ron.

724
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,103
他喝醉了回到家里
He came home drunk.

725
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,397
开始叫喊
He started yelling.

726
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,607
说我自以为很聪明
Saying I thought I was smart,

727
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,193
读我的书 把他看成一个笨蛋
reading my books and looking at him like he's dumb.

728
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,071
怎么了？他伤害你了吗？
What happened? Did he hurt you?

729
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,323
不 他没有碰我
No, he didn't touch me.

730
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,793
我努力想阻止他…
I tried to stop him...

731
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,212
-对不起 -帕克
-I'm sorry. -Paco.

732
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,633
帕克 没事 真的 没事的
Paco, it's okay. Really. It's okay.

733
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,595
跟我来吧 我们能处理好的 好吗？
You know what? Come with me. We can fix this together. All right?

734
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,227
解决问题的第一步
So, the first step to fixing something

735
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,899
就是要知道 不管破损看上去 有多严重 都是能补救好的
is to know no matter how destroyed it seems, it can always be saved.

736
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,737
书也不例外 你明白吗？
Books are no exception. You got it?

737
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,155
明白
Got it.

738
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,117
这有一台印机 其实就是个巨大的夹钳
So what we have here is a lying press. Basically just a huge clamp.

739
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,328
聚醋酸乙烯酯胶水
Polyvinyl-acetate glue,

740
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:41,415
意思是不会有酸烧坏书页 这里有针、线
means no acid to burn the pages. Got your needle, thread,

741
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,502
最后 还有兔八哥那里弄来的…
and finally, right out of <i>Bugs Bunny...</i>

742
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,795
可靠的锤子
a trusty mallet.

743
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,590
看到这个了吗？
You see this?

744
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,094
我们不需要这个
We don't need this.

745
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,892
乔诺！听听这个
[Benji] Johno! Listen to this.

746
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,228
“亲爱的本吉 我听说了你的汽水

Would love to discuss. Perhaps even try some? Jeff Pevensey."

749
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,318
是你一直在转发他推特的那个人吗？
That's the dude you're always retweeting?

750
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,654
他是《纽约》杂志的编辑
It's the culture guy from <i>New York</i> magazine.

751
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,241
回复他啊 兄弟
Hit him back, bro.

752
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,202
当然 我得想好怎么回复他 别烦我
No shit. Back off while I think.

753
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,748
杰夫 逗号 收到你的短信很高兴 兄弟 句号
Jeff, comma, so nice to hear from you, bud, period.

754
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,167

I would love to meet up to have you try the goods, period.

756

让我们安排一下吧
Let's set something up.

757
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,972
顺着书脊小心地刮
Scrape carefully along the spine.

758
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,266
当然 你也要小心别刮到手指
Of course, you've got to watch your fingers.

759
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,727
[cell phone vibrates]

760
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,025
“听上去不错 我可以在会议的空档 给你电话看你有没有空”
"Sounds great. I can call between meetings to see if you're available."

761
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,736
这会让我们更上一层楼
This is gonna take us next level.

762
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,862
我们什么时候能见他？
What time do you think we'll meet?

763
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,617
无意冒犯 我们讨论过的
No offense, we discussed this.

764
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,037
在初期 产品还是让一个人 来介绍比较好
It's best if the product has one clear face at the beginning.

765
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,914
让我来更合适
That's just more me.

766
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,544
好 书脊缝好了
[Joe] <i>Okay, the spine is sewn.</i>

767
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,921
你拿着这个 尽可能拉紧 那边
So you take this, pull it as tight as you can, that way.

768
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,799
对 就是这样
Yeah. That's it.

769
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:23,892

773

往下走就行了 向左拐
It's just down. To the left.

785

嘿 伙计 我在想也许…

你跟你的女朋友们说你会过来 我知道 因为你的手机在我这里
<i>You told your girlfriends you'd come by.</i> <i>I know this because I have your phone.</i>

Remember me? From almost dying on the train tracks? [chuckles]

791
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,224
我要想想 等等

我们已经有只有我们俩才懂的笑话了
[Joe] <i>We already have in-jokes.</i>

803
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,554
那么…

总之 礼物你收到了 我最好…

Maybe if you're not too busy, we could get a drink sometime?

806
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,232
当然可以
Sure.

807
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,277
但我还是没找到我的手机
Ugh. But I still can't find my phone.

00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,404

809
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,615

我并不总是对的 我是人 会犯错
[Joe] <i>I'm not always right. I'm human.</i> <i>I make mistakes.</i>

815
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,848
你们会看到的
<i>You'll see.</i>
